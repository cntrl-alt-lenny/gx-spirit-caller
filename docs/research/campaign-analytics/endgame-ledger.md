# Endgame ledger: remaining uncovered code, by bytes

Snapshot: 2026-07-16, commit `a9c4772d`. **Byte-derived**, not hand-transcribed
— every number below is computed directly from the committed
`config/<region>/**/delinks.txt` tier (brief 583), the same source
`tools/progress.py` already treats as the project's no-build ground truth.

> The previous version of this document (a hand transcription of brief
> prose) explained 11.6% of the real gap, had every EUR row wrong, and had
> no row at all for the single largest gap (ov004, 33% of the total). See
> [§ What changed](#what-changed-from-the-prose-ledger) below for the
> specifics. This version supersedes it entirely.

## Method (reproducible from any commit)

`tools/progress.py::parse_delinks_file` + `CODE_SECTIONS` (`{.text,
.init}`) is the canonical delinks-tier parser — this ledger adds no new
parsing logic, it just calls that parser once per `delinks.txt` (main,
`itcm`, `dtcm`, every `overlays/ov*`) instead of once per region, so the
per-module breakdown survives instead of being collapsed into one number.
A module's **gap** is `total_code - matched_code`: `total_code` sums
`CODE_SECTIONS` bytes from the module-level section map (the file's
authoritative byte range), `matched_code` sums the same sections from TUs
whose status is `complete` (excluding `_dsd_gap@...` synthetic entries,
which never appear in committed `delinks.txt` — dsd only ever synthesizes
those at build time for whatever a `delinks.txt` does *not* claim).

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "tools")
import progress as pg
from pathlib import Path

def module_gap(delinks_path):
    module_sections, tus = pg.parse_delinks_file(delinks_path)
    total = sum(max(0, e - s) for n, s, e in module_sections if n in pg.CODE_SECTIONS)
    matched = sum(
        max(0, e - s)
        for tu in tus
        if not tu["source"].startswith("_dsd_gap") and tu["status"] == "complete"
        for n, s, e in tu["sections"] if n in pg.CODE_SECTIONS
    )
    return matched, total, total - matched

# Walk config/<region>/arm9/{delinks.txt, itcm/delinks.txt, dtcm/delinks.txt,
# overlays/ov*/delinks.txt} per region and sum module_gap()'s third element.
```

No build, no wine, no ninja — this whole ledger is derived read-only from
files already committed to `main`.

## Totals

| Region | Matched (B) | Total code (B) | **Gap (B)** |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| EUR | 2,374,740 | 2,388,172 | **13,432** |

## Per-module gap, all 3 regions

Every module with a nonzero gap in at least one region (`dtcm` carries no
`kind:function` entries in any region — 0 everywhere, omitted). Sorted by
3-region total, descending. **Rows sum exactly to the measured total**
(55,540 B) — verified by direct recomputation, not by construction alone.

| Module | EUR gap (B) | USA gap (B) | JPN gap (B) | 3-region total (B) | % of 55,540 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

**ov004 is the largest single gap at 36.2% of the total** (5,902 EUR +
7,104 USA + 7,104 JPN = 20,110 B) — it had no row anywhere in the prose
ledger.

## What changed from the prose ledger

### USA/JPN main floor — not permanent; 12 of 14 named addresses now matched

The old §1 listed 7 addresses per region (14 total) as a **permanent**
verify-fail/gate-fail floor, cross-region reproducibility cited as proof
of structural walls. Re-checked individually against the current tree:

| Address | EUR | USA | JPN |
|---|---|---|---|
| `020b40cc` | matched | **matched** | **matched** |
| `020b40e0` | matched | **matched** | **matched** |
| `020b2c38` | matched | **matched** | **matched** |
| `020b3b84` | matched | **matched** | **matched** |
| `02020fa4` | matched | **matched** | **matched** |
| `020b3988` | matched | **matched** | **matched** |
| `02099834` | matched (as `func_02099718`, drift band) | still a gap | still a gap |

Only **one** of the seven named addresses (`02099834`) remains open in
USA/JPN — the other six shipped once brief 583's own returncode fix
(`tools/batch_carve.py`) and the "main floor autopsy" emitter fix
(`tools/asm_escape.py`, cross-function tail-merge labels + single-register
push/pop byte-exactness) landed. This is the concrete, measured version of
r5's point: deterministic *tool* bugs reproducing identically across
regions looked like a structural floor, and weren't one. `02099834` is the
one address dsd's delink flags specially ("Function at 0x02099834 was
adjusted to include pre-code constant pool at 0x02099820") — worth a
dedicated look, not a default assumption of permanence. The remaining USA
(4,660 B) / JPN (4,544 B) `main` gap in the table above includes this
address plus whatever else in `main` isn't yet a named/tracked park.

### EUR data blobs — closed

The old §2 listed `020b2d2c` and `020b3c78` as pending (Brief 578). Both
are now matched: `src/main/func_020b2d2c.s`, `src/main/func_020b3c78.s`.
Closed; no longer a residual.

### EUR non-floor ov006 parks — phantom, struck

**The old §6 (11 EUR ov006 "verify-fail, non-floor" parks) is struck.**
Measured directly: `config/eur/arm9/overlays/ov006/delinks.txt` has
`matched_code == total_code == 102,972` — **zero gap**. Whatever those 11
addresses represented at the time §6 was written, ov006 in the current
tree is 100% matched. This is exactly r5's finding (independently
reproduced): every one of those park addresses sits inside a `complete` C
TU, not a real residual.

### ITCM — corrected split (11 EUR + 14 USA + 14 JPN, not "39 EUR")

The old §7 recorded "39 uncarved ITCM functions" as an undifferentiated
EUR-only count, sourced from an r4 discussion that never enumerated
addresses. Directly censused (both at the function level via
`tools/size_census.py` post-fix, and at the byte level via
`parse_delinks_file` — the two independently agree):

| Region | ITCM functions | Unmatched functions | Gap (B) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| EUR | 14 | 11 | 1,940 |
| USA | 14 | 14 | 2,156 |
| JPN | 14 | 14 | 2,156 |

39 total unmatched functions, split 11/14/14 — not 39 in EUR alone. EUR
has already carved 3 of its 14; USA/JPN haven't started. `itcm` was
previously invisible to every census tool (`size_census.py`'s
`_module_paths()` never yielded it) — see brief 583's `tools/size_census.py`
fix in the same PR as this ledger.

### Carried forward, not re-verified this pass

The old §4 (permanent ISA floor: `mcr`/`mrc`/`swi`/`msr`/`mrs`-carrying
`.s` files, 42 EUR / 26 USA / 26 JPN) and §5 (parked near-miss C-match
families) are function-level research catalogues, not byte-gap accounting
— out of scope for this brief's byte re-derivation. They are **not**
struck, but also not independently re-verified here; treat them as
carried forward from the prior ledger pending their own audit.

## Source accounting notes

- This ledger's numbers are exact for commit `a9c4772d` and will drift as
  soon as the next carve/match lands — that's expected of any point-in-time

  derivation. Re-run the method above against a fresh checkout rather than
  trusting this snapshot once meaningful time has passed.
- `dtcm` is walked by the method above (for completeness/symmetry with
  `itcm`) but carries no `kind:function` entries in any region, so it
  never contributes a nonzero row.
- The 3-region total dropped from 61,404 B (r5's snapshot, commit
  `97e0ef5a`) to 55,540 B by the time this ledger was written, purely from
  real work landing in between (main-floor-autopsy-577, cmatch-ov-579,
  cmatch-queue-580) — a live demonstration of why this document needs to
  be regenerated from bytes on demand, not maintained as hand-written
  prose that answers a question about a tree that no longer exists by the
  time someone reads it.
